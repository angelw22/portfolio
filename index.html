We analysed the website they had, and created personas for their target users. We then did interviews with people who fell in the target demographic, and found out what kinds of information they actually wanted to know about their neighbourhood. <br><br> In redesigning the website, we streamlined these taskflows with maximised efficiency and effectiveness/usability, and iterated to this final product. Using tabs, we branched the website into two main goals/task flows: events and news. We added the new social element of community events to bring out the true meaning of a neighbourhood for our target users, which is community involvement.", 
        "This module was about recreating a sense of a place. We learnt what comprised a sense of place, and explored technologies which can help recreate this. We were tasked to recreate the sense of place for the abolished Sungei Road Flea Market. Understanding the practical limitations of the resources we had - if we really wanted to fully recreate SRM in the form of a simulacrum we could have just decided on a virtual reality experience, but this is difficult to accurately represent - we decided that an app would be sufficiently effective to convey the narratives which made up Sungei Road Market. <br><br> We designed this app to allow people to roam freely around a stipulated area around Sungei Road Market, and to provide them with stories as they venture in the space and discover various artefacts which provide meaning to Sungei Road Market and its inhabitants.", 
        "This was done for a data visualization module, which was about designing for a way to best view different dimensions of data, in ways which are easier to comprehend visually than traditional graphs. It involved the team ploughing through the government's public database and searching for trends between completely distinct datasets.", 
        "You can use a google cardboard. Else, on desktop, click in the window and move your cursor to look around. Use the W and S keys to move forward or backward in the direction you are facing. <br><br> This was a recent venture into WebVR, using HTML and Javascript, and plugins from various sources. The purpose of this was to aid the teaching and learning of big data. This was meant to solve the limitations of 2D mediums (incomprehensible with more dimensions) through helping the students obtain the meaning of the data through physicality. This means that they are instinctively able to understand how the data points relate to one another through a subconscious understanding of how the space is constructed.<br><br>I learnt to code this by myself, and found the datasets and plugged it in accordingly.
